## Known bugs

### Fix output when screensize is too small. 
When the terminal window's height is smaller than the number of lines the script attempts to display, the terminal starts scrolling. This results in repetitive or overlapping content, making the output unreadable. 
In the meantime, I've added a check for minimum terminal size. The minimum is 50Ã—45.

## TO DO

### Add a Help screen
Add a --help flag for users who want to see usage information.

## Common Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

### 1. Missing MySQL Credentials
If the script fails to connect to your MySQL server due to missing credentials, you may need to create a `~/.my.cnf` file for automatic authentication.

#### Steps to Create `.my.cnf`:
1. Create the file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.my.cnf
    ```

2. Add the following structure to the file:
    ```makefile
    [client]
    user=your_mysql_username
    password=your_mysql_password
    ```

3. Secure the file permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf
    ```

4. Rerun the script.

### 2. Running the Script with `sudo`
If you encounter permission issues as a non-root user, try running the script with `sudo`:
```bash
sudo ./mysqlmonitor.sh
```

---

### 3. Verifying MySQL Status
If the script fails to connect even with credentials:
- Ensure the MySQL server is running:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mysql
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status mariadb
    ```
- Verify that the credentials in `~/.my.cnf` are correct.
